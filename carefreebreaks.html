            <h2>The Brief</h2>
            <p>Carefreebreaks is a non-profit social enterprise that provides 
                free holiday accommodation for unpaid carers. The current process 
                relies on Carer Support Organisations (CSOs) as both the carers and 
                Carefreebreaks both need to have form a relationship with the CSOs.
            </p>

            <p>Existing flow for unpaid carer to get a free holiday accommodation</p>
            </div>



            <p>In order to streamline this referral process, Carefreebreaks wanted
                 to a way for carers to refer themselves for a holiday. To do this, 
                 they wanted to use YOTI, a digital identification tool, and asked us to integrate it into the existing website. </p>
        </section>

        <hr />

            <h2>User Interviews</h2>
            <p>We interviewed 10 carers who had used Carefreebreaks to book a holiday 
                through phone calls. The findings that had the most impact on our project 
                were based on what the users thought about and how they interacted with internet. 
             </p>

             <ul>
                 <li>4 of 10 users only used their mobile phone to access the internet.</li>
                <li>7 of 10 users were suspicious about sharing their information on the internet.</li>
                <li>5 of 10 users considered themselves as competent internet users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Contextual Analysis</h2>
            <p>We analysed YOTI and decided that it was not the best solution for self-referral. 
                <br>
                    Business needs: 
                    Carefreebreaks needed a way to validate that the carers were receiving carer’s allowance, 
                    and having a digital identification alone wouldn’t have been enough to prove this. 
                <br>    
                    User needs: 
                    The carers were under a lot of stress everyday and did not have a lot of time for themselves. 
                    However, YOTI’s process was very lengthy and asked users to complete tasks that were not necessary 
                    such as speaking into the device to recognise their voice.

        <hr />

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        
        <p>We decided to make our own self-referral onboarding process with the following in mind: </p>
        
        <ul>

        <li>It must be straightforward and less time-consuming for the 
            carers and they are only asked to provide the necessary 
            documents to prove their carer status. </li>
        <li>Make sure that users can trust the website and upload official documents online. </li>
        <li>Design a responsive website fitting into mobile screens since there were users
                who did not own desktops and relied on their phones to access the internet. </li>
        <li>Design the process with our persona, Bethany, in mind.</li>
         </ul>  
        </p>  
        

        <div class="img-with-text">
        <img src="images/15bethany.png">
        <p>Main user persona</p>
        </div>
        <hr />

        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>We created a storyboard to show how the new self-referral process would provide value to our users. </p>

        <h2>Design Studio Outputs</h2>

        <h2>Prototyping and Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper prototype was tested with 6 users to test the flow.</li>
            <li>Mid fidelity prototype was tested with 12 unpaid carers at Carers Network.</li>
            <li>High fidelity prototype was tested with 6 users to finalise visual designs.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Key changes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the order of screens so that information is provided to the user in a more intuitive way.</li>
            <li>More explanations throughout the whole flow. </li>
            <li>Added expected information fields when signing up to a new platform such as password confirmation. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Our clients were extremely happy with the project, especially the insights 
            based on the research and the concrete evidence based on the prototype testing. 
            This new self-referral onboarding process will help Carefreebreaks to grow their user base, 
            and this will allow more unpaid carers to get the holiday that they deserve. 
        <br>
    </p>
         <p>Next steps:
        <ul>
        <li>Collect data once the new self-referral process is launched and keep iterating to improve it.</li>
        <li>Design the emails that are sent out to the users when documents have been verified.</li>
        <li>Add images throughout the self-referral onboarding process so that users remain engaged throughout.</li>
        </ul>
