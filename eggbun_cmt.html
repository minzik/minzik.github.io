            <h2>The Company</h2>
            <p>Eggbun Education is a company that teaches indivduals Korean, Japanese or Mandarin 
            languages through a mobile app.  </p>
 
            <hr />

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Lesson content writers were using word documents to create and edit the lessons which contained 
                    specific tags which would communicate the format and structure of the message to appear. 
                    </p>

                    <p>This caused several problems:
                <ul>
                    <li>It was difficult and confusing for the content writers to learn the different tags</li>
                    <li>This meant that the developers had to rewrite the documents so that it could be understood in HTML </li>
                    <li>There were lots of mistakes when the lesson was uploaded to the app</li>
                    <li>Content writers could not preview the lesson before uploading</li>    
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, this meant that developers and content writers were spending more time than necessary
                to create lessons for the app. 
                </p>
               
            <hr />

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>We created an internal Content Management Tool where the content writers could create, edit and upload the lessons on a platform without 
                relying on developers.</p>

                <hr />

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>It took some time to convince stakeholders that this project should be prioritised. </p>
