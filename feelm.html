            <h2>The Brief</h2>
            <p>I was briefed to design an app that would solve a classmate’s problem.
                I needed to produce a high-fidelity prototype in a two-week sprint.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p> My classmate had trouble choosing entertainment to consume.
                    The user is someone who has very specific tastes and gets frustrated when he feels like he has wasted his time by consuming material that he doesn’t enjoy. 
                    Through further user interviews, I found that others had a very similar problem when trying to find new entertaining content. </p>
            </section>
        <section class="project-description solution">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>I decided to focus solely on helping the user to discover movies. 
                    This app helps individuals choose movies based on their mood of emotional and intellectual engagement. 
                    I also started to realise that many people felt overwhelmed by the overload of choice, and wanted something that was more personalised. </p>
                <p>Further to this, I found a neuroscientific study which demonstrated that individuals have a different experience (in the emotional and intellectual engagement brain regions) whilst watching the same movie. 
                    It was exciting that the user research I conducted had a scientific basis. </p>

        <section class="project-description result">
                <h2>The Result</h2>
                <p>This app will help individuals to choose movies on different levels. 
                    They will save time, they will find a movie that is more suited to their mood, and they will be happier with their choice after watching it. </p>
