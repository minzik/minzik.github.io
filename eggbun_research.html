            <h2>The Company</h2>
            <p></p>
 
            <hr />

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Lesson content writers were using word documents to create and edit the lessons which contained 
                    specific tags which would communicate the format and structure of the message to appear. 
                    <br>
                This caused several problems:
                <ul>
                    <li>It was difficult and confusing for the content writers to learn the different tags</li>
                    <li>This meant that the developers had to rewrite the documents so that it could be understood in HTML </li>
                    <li>There were lots of mistakes when the lesson was uploaded to the app</li>
                    <li>Content writers could not preview the lesson before uploading</li>    
                </ul>
                

                    <br>
                </p>
               

                Prone to making mistakes 

               They could not preview the lessons before uploading.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>Through user interviews and site visit, we discovered many problem areas but one problem stood out for both cyclists and non-cyclists: Safety. 
                This was prominent especially amongst interviewees who had never tried to cycle on London’s roads. They knew how to ride bikes but they had never been 
                taught to cycle on roads. </p>

            <p>We decided to create an educational gaming app that teaches 
                individuals how to cycle safely on London’s roads. In a busy city like London, 
                the users wanted to be certain that they were prepared before challenging themselves 
                and their safety. Additionally, the users didn’t want to commit a lot of time to learn 
                as they didn’t know if they would continue to cycle. So we wanted to provide an easy way 
                for our users to learn. </p>

            <p>In addition to teaching safety, the app incentivises the users by rewarding them with free 
                Santander Cycle rides when completing levels. By reducing the barrier to entry, the users 
                would be encouraged to cycle on the road for the first time. </p>

            <hr />

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The project addressed the brief's main problem of encouraging people who do not cycle by lowering
                the barrier to entry, whilst also helping individuals to feel safe on London's roads. </p>

            <p>Next steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Work on game interactivity</li>
                <li>Research effect of free rides with users</li>
                <li>Consider integrate the game with Santander’s existing app</li>
            </uL>
