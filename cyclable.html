            <h2>The Brief</h2>
            <p>Encouraging people to cycle is one of the key components of Mayor Sadiq Khan’s plan to help Londoners lead healthier and more active lives. 
                Transport of London want to find a way to encourage people who are still unsure about cycling in the city to use the Santander Cycles scheme. </p>
 
            <hr />

            <h2>Surveys</h2>
            <p>We sent out a survey online that asked people about their travel behaviour in London. Through this method, we were able to filter and recruit research 
                participants. We tried to recruit two groups of interviewees; we wanted to talk to frequent London cyclists to understand why and how they started cycling, 
                and also talked to people who did not cycle in London. </p>

            <hr />   

            <h2>User Interview</h2>
            
            <p>During the interviews, we asked individuals in more depth about their London travel behaviour in more depth. 
                We wanted to understand how they travelled and the reason behind their behavour. 
                Further to this, they were also specifically asked about their attitude and feelings towards cycling in London.</p>
            
            <p>Through user interviews we discovered many problem areas but one problem stood out for both cyclists and non-cyclists: Safety. 
                This was prominent especially amongst interviewees who had never tried to cycle on London’s roads. They knew how to ride bikes but they had never been 
                taught to cycle on roads. </p>

            <hr />   

            <h2>Site Visit</h2>
                <p>We used the Santander bikes ourselves to ride around London. </p>

            <p>We decided to create an educational gaming app that teaches 
                individuals how to cycle safely on London’s roads. In a busy city like London, 
                the users wanted to be certain that they were prepared before challenging themselves 
                and their safety. Additionally, the users didn’t want to commit a lot of time to learn 
                as they didn’t know if they would continue to cycle. So we wanted to provide an easy way 
                for our users to learn. </p>

            <p>In addition to teaching safety, the app incentivises the users by rewarding them with free 
                Santander Cycle rides when completing levels. By reducing the barrier to entry, the users 
                would be encouraged to cycle on the road for the first time. </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The project addressed the brief's main problem of encouraging people who do not cycle by lowering
                the barrier to entry, whilst also helping individuals to feel safe on London's roads. </p>

            <p>Next steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Work on game interactivity</li>
                <li>Research effect of free rides with users</li>
                <li>Consider integrate the game with Santander’s existing app</li>
            </uL>
