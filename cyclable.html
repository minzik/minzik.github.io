            <h2>The Brief</h2>
            <p>Encouraging people to cycle is one of the key components of Mayor Sadiq Khan’s plan to help Londoners lead healthier and more active lives. 
                Transport of London want to find a way to encourage people who are still unsure about cycling in the city to use the Santander Cycles scheme. 
                In a two week sprint, I worked on this concept brief with three other UX Designers. </p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Through user interviews and contextual enquiry, we discovered many problem areas but one problem stood out: Safety. 
                    This was prominent especially amongst interviewees who had never tried to cycle on London’s roads. 
                    They knew how to ride bikes but they had never been taught to cycle on roads. </p>
            </section>
        <section class="project-description solution">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>We decided to create an educational gaming app that teaches individuals how to cycle safely on London’s roads. 
                    In a busy city like London, the users wanted to be certain that they were prepared before challenging themselves and their safety. 
                    Additionally, the users didn’t want to commit a lot of time to learn as they didn’t know if they would continue to cycle. So we wanted to provide an easy way for our users to learn. </p>
                <p>In addition to teaching safety, the app incentivises the users by rewarding them with free Santander Cycle rides when completing levels. 
                    By reducing the barrier to entry, the users would be encouraged to cycle on the road for the first time. </p>

        <section class="project-description result">
                <h2>The Result</h2>
                <p>This game app will help Transport of London’s goal to encourage more people to cycle, and to help individuals feel safer when cycling on London’s roads. </p>
